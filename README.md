# Next Gen TV Show Recommendations

The **Next Gen TV Show Recommendations Project** is a collaboration with **DirecTV** via **Breakthrough Tech AI**. Our goal is to develop a popularity prediction model that helps producers decide which shows to greenlight for production by predicting how popular a TV show will be. The model leverages techniques such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling by **BERT**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and machine learning models like **Random Forest** to make predictions based on a large dataset.

## Project Overview

The **Next Gen TV Show Recommendations Project** involves analyzing a dataset of **150,000 items** to predict how popular TV shows will be using **BERT** for sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and **Random Forest** for making predictions. Our primary aim is to assist producers in selecting shows that are likely to attract large audiences by analyzing different features such as show descriptions, genre, language, and other metadata.

We have implemented multiple methodologies to preprocess the data, create machine learning models, and evaluate them. These steps include exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and results visualization.

## Data Sources

The project uses a **150,000 item dataset** of TV shows, including attributes such as:

- **Show Metadata** (e.g., name, language, genres, production countries)
- **Text Data** (e.g., overview, tagline)
- **Numerical Data** (e.g., episode count, season count, vote averages)
  
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of TV show properties that we leverage to train our model for popularity prediction.

## Modeling Methodologies

Our modeling workflow includes the following steps:

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values and outliers
   - Feature encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding for categorical features)
   - Data scaling (e.g., using `StandardScaler` for numerical features)

### 2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Text processing using **BERT** for extracting relevant features from show descriptions.
   - Sentiment analysis and topic modeling to enhance the prediction capabilities.

### 3. **Modeling Techniques**  
   - **Random Forest** for classification tasks, using various features to predict show popularity.
   - **XGBoost** for advanced boosting, fine-tuning the hyperparameters for improved model performance.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and **R-squared (RÂ²)** scores are used to evaluate the models' performance.
